# SportsVerse
Sport Event Management System for University/Colleges.


During any sports event hosted or conducted at college/university  sometimes students find it difficult to find information about match schedules and about points 
Table of any particular sport like for example cricket.
So, we created a website or web application which provide/gives information about fixture and points table of particular sports. We named our application “SportsVerse”.
We used web development(HTML,CSS, JS and php) to make our project.
The user has to just select sport and then if he can choose from fixture and points table of that sport. By this he can get whole information  of that event 
on his fingers.


# Objective-
During sport event conducted by a university many colleges/universities take part in that. But sometimes students find it difficult to get information about different 
sport fixtures, previous matches results or points table.
To solve this problem, we can create “ Sport Event Management System” where anyone who is interested to get information about sport event can seek it and get whole 
information at one place.We will make a Database to store all the information regarding event and them for frontend we will make a website to show required 
information to user.

# Technology Used-
